State Management Plan

Local State

Tool: FlutterFlow’s built-in local state management tools

Why:

Fully integrated into FlutterFlow.

Simplifies development and debugging without requiring additional libraries.

Designed for straightforward local UI interactions (e.g., toggle states, form inputs).

Global State

Tool: Firebase Authentication and Firestore

Why:

Firebase Authentication: Simplifies managing user login/logout state.

Firestore: Provides real-time and persistent storage for global settings (e.g., alert thresholds, default trading preferences).

Approach:

Implement Firestore listeners to monitor changes to global app settings in real-time.

Use FlutterFlow’s Firestore integration to fetch and cache global state data when needed.

Server State Synchronization

Tool: Firestore’s real-time capabilities

Why:

Firestore’s real-time listeners ensure seamless synchronization of trading signals and notifications.

Eliminates the need for external state management tools for server synchronization.

Example Flow:

Trade Signal Update: Trade signals are updated in Firestore.

Trigger Listener: Firestore triggers a listener in the app.

UI Update: The app UI instantly reflects the new data.

Persistence

Tools:

Firestore:

For persistent data such as user settings and cached trading metrics.

Automatically syncs data across devices.

shared_preferences:

For lightweight session data or preferences (e.g., last login time, cached themes).

Key FlutterFlow Features to Leverage

Firebase Integration:

Use Firebase Authentication for managing user sessions.

Integrate Firestore for both real-time and persistent global state.

Custom Actions:

Write custom actions in FlutterFlow for advanced state updates or calculations.

Local State Management:

Utilize FlutterFlow’s built-in tools for managing temporary, widget-specific data.

Final Recommendations

Simplify State Management:

Use FlutterFlow’s tools and Firebase for a streamlined and cohesive development process.

Real-Time Updates:

Leverage Firestore listeners for trading signals and other real-time updates.

Cross-Device Consistency:

Persist global preferences and configurations in Firestore.

Lightweight Storage:

Use shared_preferences for quick, temporary session storage.

Next Steps

Set up Firestore listeners and Firebase Authentication as part of this workflow.

Define specific global state fields (e.g., alert thresholds, trading preferences).
