Full Project Documentation

Overview

This document consolidates all components of the project plan for the same-day SPX options trading bot, covering frontend, backend, state management, database schema, API communication, third-party libraries, and deployment pipeline.

Frontend

Key Components:

Framework: Flutter for cross-platform development.

Libraries: Material Design (Android/web) and Cupertino (iOS).

Navigation: Bottom navigation bar with main tabs (Home/Signals, Performance, Account, More/Help).

State Management: FlutterFlow’s built-in tools for local state; Firebase Authentication and Firestore for global state.

Styling: Material Design principles with custom branding, including dark mode.

Backend

Key Components:

Framework: Python with FastAPI for high-performance API development.

Database: Firebase Firestore for real-time and persistent data management.

Authentication: Firebase Authentication for user login/logout and OAuth2 for broker integrations.

API Design: RESTful endpoints for trading signals, trade execution, and performance metrics.

Real-Time Updates: Firestore listeners and optional WebSocket implementation for trading signals.

State Management

Key Tools:

Local State: FlutterFlow’s built-in state tools for temporary, widget-specific interactions.

Global State:

Firebase Authentication for managing user sessions.

Firestore for storing global preferences and app settings.

Server State Synchronization: Firestore’s real-time listeners to synchronize trading data.

Persistence:

Firestore for cross-device persistent settings.

shared_preferences for lightweight session data storage.

Database Schema

Entities and Relationships:

User: Primary entity linked to multiple trading signals and trade history.

Trading Signal: Stores recommendations generated by the algorithm.

Trading History: Tracks completed/attempted trades.

App Settings: Optional entity for global configurations.

Key Relationships:

User ↔ Trading Signal: A user can have multiple trading signals.

User ↔ Trading History: A user can execute multiple trades.

Trading Signal ↔ Trading History: A trade is linked to a specific signal.

Indexed Fields:

user_id, timestamp, confidence_score, trade_result for efficient querying.

API Communication

Endpoints:

Trading Signals:

GET /signals: Retrieve active signals.

Trade Execution:

POST /trade: Submit trades.

Performance Metrics:

GET /performance: Fetch historical metrics.

Features:

Consistent error handling with standardized HTTP status codes.

WebSocket support for real-time signal and trade status updates.

Firebase Authentication for secure API access.

Third-Party Libraries

Financial Data APIs: Alpaca, Polygon.io, Alpha Vantage.

Frontend Development: Flutter, Material Design, Cupertino Widgets.

Backend Development: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (optional), PyJWT.

Testing: Pytest, Flutter Test, Postman/Newman.

Analytics & Monitoring: Google Analytics, Sentry.

Deployment Pipeline

CI/CD Pipeline:

Tools: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automation.

Stages:

Build: Compile the Flutter frontend.

Test: Run unit tests for backend and frontend.

Deploy: Automate deployments using Firebase Hosting for frontend and FastAPI on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud).

Environments:

Dev: Firebase dev environment for testing.

Staging: Firebase staging environment for pre-release testing.

Prod: Firebase production environment for final releases.

Initial Development Steps

Key Features to Implement:

Trading Signal Ingestion:

Integrate with financial APIs (e.g., Alpaca).

Process and store real-time signals in Firestore.

User Authentication:

Implement Firebase Authentication with login/logout flows.

Trade Execution:

Develop POST /trade endpoint.

Test execution logic with mock data.

Development Milestones:

Week 1-4:

Set up project architecture.

Build user authentication and basic frontend layout.

Week 5-8:

Develop trading signal ingestion.

Implement real-time updates via Firestore listeners.

Week 9-12:

Finalize trade execution features.

Perform end-to-end testing.

Launch MVP.
